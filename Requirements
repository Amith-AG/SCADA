To build the mini SCADA project described, the following requirements and software are necessary:

Hardware Requirements:

Microcontroller Unit: NodeMCU ESP8266 development board
Display Unit: LCD display or LED display module
Power Supply Unit: 9V battery, 7805 IC voltage regulator, capacitors, and connectors
Gas Sensing Unit: MQ4 gas sensor module
Temperature and Humidity Sensing Unit: DHT22 sensor module
Heating System: Incandescent light bulb
Cooling System: 12V DC fan
Warning System: Buzzer, LED, resistors, and connectors
Breadboard or PCB (Printed Circuit Board) for circuit connections
Jumper wires, connectors, and other necessary electronic components

Software Requirements:

Arduino IDE: An integrated development environment for programming the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller board. It can be downloaded from the official Arduino website.
Libraries: Install the required libraries for the DHT22 sensor and MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, which may include the Adafruit DHT library and PubSubClient library.
